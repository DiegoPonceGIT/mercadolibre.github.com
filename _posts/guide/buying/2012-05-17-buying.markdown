# Buying

Before buying make sure you have the `item_id` of the product you're trying to purchase. If this is not the case, you can perform a [search](/search) to retrieve the corresponding ID needed to perform the operation.

You should be ready to buy your item. You can use the code below as a reference:


<pre class="terminal">

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
'{ "order_items":[
	{"item_id":$ITEM_ID,
	 "quantity": 1
	}
	] 
}'

</pre>
