# Searching
Searching using the MELI API is very intuitive and straight forward. If you want search for specific items as if you were doing it through our website, you can
use the search api as follows:

<pre class="terminal">
curl https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLA/search?q=ipod
</pre>

This API call returns the search results of the specified query in JSON format. You may also send other parameters to the search API to refine your search.    

For example:	
	
	....sites/MLA/search?category=...  (Search items in a specified category)    
	....sites/MLA/search?seller_id=...  (Search items by specific seller id)    
	....sites/MLA/search?nickname=...   (Search items by seller nickname)    
	

For more information about search options you can check the website [https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLA/search/](https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLA/search/)
