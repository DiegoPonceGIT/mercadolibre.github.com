#Notifications

Listening to Notifications give you the ability to have a real-time feed of the changes that occur on the different resources of the MercadoLibre platform.
	If you published an item and it has been paused because or someone made you a question, purchase your item or even paid for it and requested a shipping, you will receive a Notification.
	Notifications are a very convenient way of stay up-to-date with everything that you care, in a very efficient way for your app, without having to query our APIs on a constant basis.

##How do I subscribe to the Notifications? {#how-to-subscribe}
In the Applications Page where you created your App, you can edit the details and specify which 'topics' you will listen to.
(see [Applications Page](http://applications.mercadolibre.com.ar/home)).
_If you haven't created your App yet go to [Creating your app section] (http://developers.mercadolibre.com/creating-your-own-application/)_

  - **Notifications callback URL** Configure the public URL of your domain where you want to receive notifications for the different topics. e.g.: “http://myshoes-app.com/callbacks”.

  - **Topics** Comma separated list of 'topics' you want to subscribe to.

###Available Topics: {#topics}
- **orders**  — To get notified of any 'news' on an order. e.g.: you received an order from a purchase, the buyer added shipping instructions or the buyer added a payment to an order.

- **items**   — To get notified of any changes on an item you have published. 
	e.g.: Due to infringement of one of MercadoLibre's rules your item was set to 'under_review' and paused. 
	The seller changed any of an item's attribute (price, title, description) and all the application's subscribed to that seller's feed get notified of the change.
	The 60 days period of a listing finished.

- **questions**   — To receive a notification for every question made to you or answered.

> NOTE: All the applications subscribed to the question feed will receive notifications for every answer the seller sends.


###Considerations receiving notifications: {#considerations}
* Messages will be sent out and retried during 12 hours. After that period, if not accepted by the app, they will be discarded.

* Your application must acknowledge the reception with an HTTP status code 200, otherwise the message will be considered not delivered and it will be retried.

* Your application must send a response within 20 seconds, otherwise it will timeout considered not delivered and retried.
