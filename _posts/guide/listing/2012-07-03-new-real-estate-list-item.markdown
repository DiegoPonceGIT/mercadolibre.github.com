List your real estate property 	{#publish}
---------------------------------

We have developed our APIs based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank"> REST architecture</a> via HTTP requests in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json" target="_blank">JSON format</a>.

Available REST operations for our APIs are: GET, POST, PUT & DELETE.

You can list a real estate property by sending a POST request to our Items API with the following JSON:

### Putting together the publication JSON ###	{#puttingtoghetherJSON}

Once all the info is gathered, you will have to POST the JSON to our Items API.

A real estate property JSON is composed by the following information (an example is provided below the table):

<!-- ### JsonFieldsTable {#JsonFieldsTable} -->

----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
site_id\*			  |	ID of the site your user belongs to. Obtained in the [Category selection section](#categselection).
title\*				  |	Title of your listing.
category_id\*		  |	ID of the chosen category for your listing. Obtained in the [Category selection section](#categselection).
price\*				  |	Price of the property. Always send a real price, otherwise your listing will be removed.
currency_id\*		  |	Currency of the price. Allowed currencies vary according to your user's country. You can obtain all available currency options at https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites. Click on your Site ID and you will be now able to get the currencies element with all the available currencies and their IDs.
available_quantity\*  |	Available quantity of the property (generally 1)
buying_mode\*		  |	For real estate properties, always send a "classified" value.

### Sending the JSON to the API ### {#sendjson}

Once you have the JSON, you can validate your listing by sending it in a POST request body to the following URL:

<pre class="terminal">
 https://api.mercadolibre.com/items/validate?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
</pre>

In the request headers include:
<pre class="terminal">
 content-type: application/json
 accepts: application/json
</pre>
If the response status code is "200 OK" or "204 No content", then the JSON was successfully validated and your property is ready to be listed.

Note: this validation process is not mandatory, but will most likely become handy when testing your APP. Keep in mind that there is no sandbox nor pre-production environment, so every property listed during your testing phase will be visible in our platform by all of our users. It is highly reccomended that you finalize listed items posted while testing.

**To list an item, POST the property JSON to the following URL:**

<pre class="terminal">
 https://api.mercadolibre.com/items?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
</pre>

If the property was successfully listed, you will receive a "201 Created" response status and all of the created item information in the response body (JSON formatted). <u>It is highly recommended that you track the <b>Item ID</b> received</u> (ie: MLA12345678), since you will be needing it later on when modifying or finalizing it.

Note: after successfully listing an item, its status will be "not yet active" until it passes our security filters and automatically gets activated. This process should take no longer than an hour.

**Congratulations! You have successfully finished the publication process of a real estate property using our APIs.**

If you were to receive an error status code on a response when communicating with our APIs, in most cases you will be able to determine the cause of the error by looking at the response body. In addition to the response status code, the response body will also contain detailed information regarding the error and will most likely help you understand how to solve different issues.

You can now follow the instructions to:

[Modify, pause or finalize your property publication](http://www.somelink.com)

[Relist your properties](http://www.somelink.com)
