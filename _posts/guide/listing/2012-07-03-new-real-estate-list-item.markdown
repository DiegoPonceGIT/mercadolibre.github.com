You can list a real estate property by sending a POST request to our Items API with a JSON like the the following example:

{% highlight javascript %}

{ 
  "site_id": "MLA", <-- Indicates the country you are publishing in
  "title": "Property title",
  "category_id": "MLA1474", <-- Indicates the operation and property type
  "price": 50000,
  "currency_id": "ARS",
  "available_quantity": 1,
  "buying_mode": "classified",
  "listing_type_id": "silver", <-- Indicates the type of publication your item will be listed in
  "condition": "not_specified",
  "pictures": [
    {
      "id": "MLA2096545948_102011" <-- Indicates the picture ID if you have previously uploaded it to our Pictures API
    },
    {
      "source":"http://media.point2.com/p2a/htmltext/f2a4/590f/3627/f49be256595a86c91457/original.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "location": {
    "address_line": "My property address 1234",
    "zip_code": "1111", <-- Recommended for Mexico and Brazil
    "neighborhood": {
      "id": "TUxBQlBBUzgyNjBa"
    },
    "latitude": -34.48755,
    "longitude": -58.56987,
  },  
  "attributes": [
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-ANTIG",
      "value_id": "MLA1472-ANTIG-A_ESTRENAR"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-DISPOSIC",
      "value_id": "MLA1472-DISPOSIC-FRENTE"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-AMBQTY",
      "value_id": "MLA1472-AMBQTY-2"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-BATHQTY",
      "value_id": "MLA1472-BATHQTY-1"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA50547-BATHQTY",
      "value_id": "MLA50547-BATHQTY-1"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-DORMQTY",
      "value_id": "MLA1472-DORMQTY-2"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-EDIFIC",
      "value_id": "MLA1472-EDIFIC-DEPARTAMENTO"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-MTRS",
      "value_name": "80"
    },
    {
      "id": "MLA1472-MTRSTOTAL",
      "value_name": "100"
    }
  ],
  "description" : "<b>This is the real estate property descritpion.</b>"
}
{% endhighlight %}

To complete the JSON with the necessary info, follow this steps:

- 1\. [Pictures upload (optional)](/res-pic-upload)
- 2\. [Category selection](/res-categ-selection)
- 3\. [Location selection](/res-loc-selection)
- 4\. [Attributes selection](/res-attrs-selection)
	
[Click here](/res-json-full-specs) to see the full specification of possible elements you can send in a real estate property JSON.

**To list a property, POST the JSON to the following URL:**

<pre class="terminal">
 https://api.mercadolibre.com/items?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
</pre>

In the request headers include:
<pre class="terminal">
 content-type: application/json
 accepts: application/json
</pre>

If the property was successfully listed, you will receive a "201 Created" response status and all of the created item information in the response body (JSON formatted). <u>It is highly recommended that you track the <b>Item ID</b> received</u> (ie: MLA12345678), since you will be needing it later on when modifying or finalizing it.

Note: after successfully listing an item, its status will be "not yet active" until it passes our security filters and automatically gets activated. This process should take no longer than an hour.

If you want you can validate your JSON before actually listing it by sending it in a POST request body to the following URL:

<pre class="terminal">
 https://api.mercadolibre.com/items/validate?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
</pre>

If the response status code is "200 OK" or "204 No content", then the JSON was successfully validated and your property is ready to be listed.

This validation process is not mandatory, but will most likely become handy when testing your APP. Keep in mind that there is no sandbox nor pre-production environment, so every property listed during your testing phase will be visible in our platform by all of our users. It is highly reccomended that you finalize listed items posted while testing.

If you were to receive an error status code on a response when communicating with our APIs, in most cases you will be able to determine the cause of the error by looking at the response body. In addition to the response status code, the response body will also contain detailed information regarding the error and will most likely help you understand how to solve different issues.

You can now follow the instructions to:

[Modify, pause or finalize your property publication](/res-modify-pause-finalize)

[Relist your properties](/res-relist)
