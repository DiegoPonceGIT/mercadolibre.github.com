#Real estate listing

Category selection	{#categselection}
------------------
To list a real estate property, you will have to choose the category which indicates the operation and property type your property will be listed in. First, determine the "SITE_ID" that corresponds to the country your user belongs to. To accomplish this go to the following URL:

<a href="https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites" target="_blank">https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites</a>

Once there you will be able to determine your SITE_ID, which is the "id" for your corresponding country.

Now that you have your SITE_ID, you can now access the following URL (by browser or by sending a GET request):

<pre class="terminal">
 https://api.mercadolibre.com/categories/SITE_ID1459
</pre>

If your user belongs, for example, to Argentina, then the URL would be: <a href="https://api.mercadolibre.com/categories/MLA1459" target="_blank">https://api.mercadolibre.com/categories/MLA1459</a>

Once there, browse within the "children categories" element, according to the operation and property type you are interested in (you can do this by clicking the "id") <u>until you reach a leaf category</u>. You will know when you have reached a leaf category once you reach a category with an empty "children_categories" array.

Save this Category ID, since you will be needing it later on, when putting together the JSON for publishing the property.
