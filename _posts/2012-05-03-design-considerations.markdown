# Design Considerations

There are some things you should know about our APIs.

## All responses are JSON encoded.
JSON is a lightweight text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. You can read more [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

## To overcome same origin policy, JSONP is also supported.
The [same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy) is an important security concept. To overcome it you can use [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP).

## Use selection to reduce the amount of returned attributes.

## Filter the ids of the required resources

## All APIs will provide documentation in JSON format using OPTIONS.

## All dates are ISO 8601 encoded.

## All errors have a standard format.
