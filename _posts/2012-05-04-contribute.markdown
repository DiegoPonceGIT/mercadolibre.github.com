# How can I contribute?

If you wish to contribute, send us the resource information including URL to developers@mercadolibre.com.  
We update our SDKs on a regular basis. All announcements will be made via Twitter [@melidevelopers](mailto:@melidevelopers) and on [developers.meli.com](http://developers.meli.com) homepage.

## Sample applications

We love sample applications. If you have something cool you want to share with our community, feel free to post it in our mailing list so others can play with it. 

## Bugs or suggestions
Most of our projects are public in GitHub. Feel free to submit pull requests or issues if you find something that needs to be reviewed.

## Community

Find us in our IRC channel #meli @ irc.freenode.net or in the discussion group [meli-developers@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/group/meli-developers)

Thanks,
